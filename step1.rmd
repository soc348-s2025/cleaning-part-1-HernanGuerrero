I am marking this as _do not eval_ so it doesn't redownload 
each time. I can save a working copy of the data and use that
when experimenting,  though still with the ability to run the whole
process. To load the saved dataset I can use the `load()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}

WilliamAugustineBrennan <- gutenberg_download(c(37388))
save (WilliamAugustineBrennan, file="WAB.rda")
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
load("WAB.rda")
```
